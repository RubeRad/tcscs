    "\n",
    "For instance, if there were a software object called `Dog`, some of its attributes might be `color`,  or `breed`, and some of its functions might be `speak()`, or `is_hungry()`. A variable `fluffy` that is a Dog object might have attribute values of `color='white'`, `breed='toy pomeranian'`, and its `speak()` method might return `'yip'`. A  variable `spike` that is also a Dog object might have attribute values of `color='black'`, `breed='doberman pinscher'`, and its `speak()` method might return `'GRRR!'`.   (For all dogs, the `is_hungry()` method probably always returns `True`.)\n",

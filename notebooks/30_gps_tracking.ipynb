    "# Analyzing GPS tracking data\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York Times article series, [*One Nation, Tracked*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html) showed how easy it is to identified individuals from their smartphone GPS tracks -- and how GPS tracks cannot be \"anonymized\" simply by omitting names:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>In most cases, ascertaining a home location and an office location was enough to identify a person. Consider your daily commute: Would any other smartphone travel directly between your house and your office every day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Describing location data as anonymous is “a completely false claim” that has been debunked in multiple studies, Paul Ohm, a law professor and privacy researcher at the Georgetown University Law Center, told us. “Really precise, longitudinal geolocation information is absolutely impossible to anonymize.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“D.N.A.,” he added, “is probably the only thing that’s harder to anonymize than precise geolocation information.”</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to do some investigative sleuthing of our own, using some GPS track data (voluntarily submitted by willing participants).  [This full dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367) from Microsoft Research contains about 25M GPS points with IDs and timestamps, in cities around the world. I've selected a subset in one particular city."

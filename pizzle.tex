\title{Pizza Puzzle}
%\maketitle

8 roommates are going to order one giant pizza, and they're having trouble
reaching consensus about the 5 available toppings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mushrooms
\item Sausage
\item Ham
\item Pineapple
\item Anchovies
\end{itemize}

They agree that everybody gets to state {\bf TWO} preferences (positive or
negative), and that they'll get a pizza if they can find a combination of
toppings that satisfies at least {\bf ONE} of everybody's preferences.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Eddie is easy-going. As long as there's either Mushrooms or Sausage, he's
  good. Eddie's preferences are $(m \lor s)$.
\item Helen {\sc hates} Hawaiian pizza. If there's no ham, or if there's no
  pineapple, then technically it's not Hawaiian, so Helen would be
  happy. Helen's preferences are $(\neg h \lor \neg p)$.
\item Jared's preferences are not sausage, or yes pineapple: $(\neg s \lor p)$
\item I didn't feel like making up 5 more names, but you get the point.
\end{enumerate}

The agreed-upon rule of satisfying at least one preference for each roommate looks like this:
$$(m \lor s) \land
(\neg h \lor \neg p) \land
(\neg s \lor p) \land
(\neg m \lor s) \land
(\neg h \lor a) \land
(\neg h \lor \neg m) \land
(\neg p \lor \neg s) \land
(\neg a \lor \neg m)$$

Can the roommates be satsfied?
